# nba-salary-prediction
Predicting NBA player salaries using machine learning involves building a model that can analyse various factors related to players, such as performance statistics, age, position, team, accolades, and other relevant features, to predict their salaries.

Data Collection 
Gathering a dataset containing information about NBA players and their salaries. This dataset includes features like player statistics (e.g., points per game, rebounds per game), demographic information (e.g., age, position), team details, and contract details (e.g., salary, contract duration). NBA Player Salaries (2022-23 Season) dataset from kaggle website has been used for this project. 

Data Preprocessing
 Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, normalize numeric features, and encode categorical variables. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training machine learning models.

Feature Selection/Engineering
Selecting relevant features that are likely to influence player salaries. Also creating new features based on domain knowledge or feature interactions to improve the model's performance.
Model Selection
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm for salary prediction. Common algorithms for regression tasks. This includes linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting.

Model Training
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Training the selected machine learning model on the training data, using techniques like cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation
Evaluating the trained model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, or R-squared. This step helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Environment 

Jupyter Notebook has been used to write this model. It is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports various programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, among others. Notebooks are organized into cells, where each cell can contain code, markdown text, or raw text. Users can execute code within these cells interactively, making it an excellent tool for data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and education.
